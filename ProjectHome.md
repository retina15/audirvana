Audirvana is an audiophile player for Mac OSX.

No equalizer, no trendy special effects, just the music

  * Direct sound path, directly to the CoreAudio HAL for pure bit perfect sound
  * Audio Device exclusive access mode
  * HAL I/O using DAC native physical formats "Integer Mode" (instead of CoreAudio 32bit float)
